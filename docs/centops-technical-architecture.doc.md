# Introduction

This document outlines the technical design for CentOps within a scope to cover functionalities for "Milestone 2 - MVP End-to-End Flow".

# Scope

The scope of current developments is to have fully functional proof of concept deployed at least on Azure.

Full scope of CentOps (planned) features and business architecture can be found on [centops-business-architecture.doc.md](https://github.com/b√ºrokratt/CentOps/blob/main/docs/centops-business-architecture.doc.md).

# Features

## Authenticate with CentOps API

* **The scope** of authentication with CentOps API is **service-to-service only,** meaning that any client-side authentication, permissions validation etc is not covered.

* Applications also assume that all incoming requests come from appropriate participants with appropriate rights without any restrictions based on network, certificates etc.

* Service-to-service requests are authenticated by passing on API keys.

* Requests from public network have also access to back-end components, which would otherwise require using Ruuter as a reverse proxy.

* Back-end components can make requests to another back-end components without using Ruuter as a reverse proxy, which would normally be forbidden.

* Service-to-service requests are authenticated by passing on [API keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface_key) via request headers.
